# ðŸ“Š Phase 3: Analysis and Insights Using Tableau

## **Project Description**
In Phase 3 of my Unicorn project, the focus is on analyzing and visualizing data using Tableau. The goal is to extract valuable insights from the cleaned dataset and present them through interactive dashboards. This will help the Unicorn team make better data-driven decisions.

## **Objectives**
- Create interactive dashboards that provide clear insights into the data.
- Answer key business questions, such as:
  - Which city is the most profitable in the state of Tennessee?
  - What is the average annual profit for that city?
  - Which product category is the most profitable in Iowa over all years?
  - Which product in that category was the most popular in 2016?
- Develop recommendations based on these insights.

## **Requirements**
- **Data Source:** Use the cleaned and consolidated dataset from Phase 2.
- **Visualizations:** Use Tableau to create dynamic and impactful dashboards.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Present the findings visually and provide actionable recommendations.

## **Deliverables**
1. **Tableau Public Link:** Publish my dashboard and share the link.
2. **Insights and Recommendations:** Incorporate screenshots of the visualizations into the presentation.
3. **Presentation:** Prepare a 5-minute presentation summarizing the key insights and recommendations.

## **Recommended Steps**
1. **Import the data:** Load the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
2. **Create visualizations:** Develop charts that answer the core analysis questions.
3. **Build dashboards:** Combine the visualizations into interactive and easy-to-understand dashboards.
4. **Draw conclusions:** Identify trends, patterns, and opportunities.
5. **Formulate recommendations:** Provide strategic suggestions based on the insights.

## **Guidelines**
- Dashboards should be clear and user-friendly.
- I will use a consistent color palette and clear labeling.
- Each visualization will focus on answering the key questions.

I am excited to bring the data to life through Tableau in this phase and uncover insights that will help the Unicorn team achieve even greater success.
